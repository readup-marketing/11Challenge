            <h2 class="story-title">Chapter Five: The Final Choice</h2>
            
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Elara looked at the seventh box. Everyone in the vault was watching her—the five honest Circle members, Gran, Silas, and the snake woman who had tried to steal the Heart of Thornwood.</p>
                
                <p>"What will you do, young Reader?" the old man in the raven mask asked. "The Heart is yours to claim or to leave. The choice is yours alone."</p>
                
                <p>Elara's hands shook as she reached for the dusty box. When she touched it, warmth spread through her fingers. The box opened easily for her, and inside she saw a beautiful red <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">crystal<span class="definition">A clear, shiny rock or glass-like object</span></span> shaped like a heart. It glowed with its own light, pulsing like it was alive.</p>
                
                <p>Voices filled her mind again—not whispers this time, but clear words. The Heart was speaking to her. "I am power," it said. "I am knowledge. I am everything you could ever want. Take me, and you will never be <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">afraid<span class="definition">Feeling fear or worry</span></span> again. You will be strong. You will be special."</p>
                
                <p>It was <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">tempting<span class="definition">Attractive in a way that makes you want something</span></span>. Elara thought about how the other children at school sometimes made fun of her for being quiet, for spending time in the library, for being different. With the Heart's power, she could show them all. She could be powerful and important.</p>
                
                <p>But then she looked at Gran. Her grandmother's face was full of worry and love. And Elara remembered what Gran had said: "The Heart cannot be taken by force. It can only be given freely." But there was something else Gran had said too—that the power came with a terrible price.</p>
                
                <p>"What is the price?" Elara asked the Heart.</p>
                
                <p>The crystal's glow became darker. "To hold me, you must give up something you love. The last person who tried to claim me had to give up their family, their friends, their whole life outside these walls. They became <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">trapped<span class="definition">Unable to escape from a place</span></span> here forever, alone with their power."</p>
                
                <p>Elara looked around the vault. She saw the wolf, who <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">collected<span class="definition">Gathered things together</span></span> his old book of family stories. The fox, holding a painting of someone she loved. The owl, with a crystal ball that helped her see the truth. The stag, with a crown that <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">represented<span class="definition">Stood for or symbolized something</span></span> the kingdom he once ruled. Even the snake woman had come for power, willing to give up everything for it.</p>
                
                <p>But the raven—the old man smiled at her with kind eyes. "I came here fifty years ago, just like your grandmother," he said. "I faced the same choice. Do you know what I chose?"</p>
                
                <p>"You chose to leave the Heart," Elara said, understanding. "You chose your family and your life over power."</p>
                
                <p>"And I have never <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">regretted<span class="definition">Felt sorry about something you did or didn't do</span></span> it," he said. "True power isn't in magic objects, Elara. It's in the choices we make and the people we love. Your Reader gift is special enough. You don't need the Heart."</p>
                
                <p>Elara looked at the glowing crystal one more time. Part of her still wanted it. But a bigger part—the part that loved Gran, that loved her quiet life and her books and her own special way of seeing the world—knew what she had to do.</p>
                
                <p>"I choose to leave it here," Elara said clearly. She placed the Heart back in its box and closed the lid. "Some things are better left alone."</p>
                
                <p>The moment she closed the box, the whole vault began to shake. Light <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">burst<span class="definition">Broke open suddenly</span></span> from every corner. The snake woman screamed as invisible chains appeared around her, pulling her away into the shadows. "No! I need that power! Let me go!"</p>
                
                <p>"The vault always punishes those who come with lies in their hearts," the raven explained. "She will be held here until she learns what true power means."</p>
                
                <p>The shaking stopped. The remaining Circle members bowed to Elara. "You have proven yourself <span class="vocab-word" onclick="toggleDefinition(this)">worthy<span class="definition">Deserving respect or attention</span></span>," the wolf said. "The Heart of Thornwood will remain safe because of your wisdom."</p>
                
                <p>One by one, the masked figures left the vault, taking their treasures with them. Soon only Elara, Gran, and the raven remained.</p>
                
                <p>"You did well, child," the raven said. "Your grandmother would be proud—and I can see she is." He removed his mask completely and smiled. "Perhaps we'll meet again someday, when another choice needs to be made."</p>
                
                <p>Gran hugged Elara tightly. "I'm so proud of you. You passed a test I once failed. Fifty years ago, I wanted to take the Heart. It was the raven who stopped me, who showed me that some powers are too dangerous, even for good people."</p>
                
                <p>"So you came back to make sure I wouldn't make the same mistake?" Elara asked.</p>
                
                <p>"I came back to support you, whatever you chose," Gran said. "But I'm glad you chose wisely."</p>
                
                <p>As they left Thornwood Manor, the sun was rising. The old building looked less scary in the morning light—just an old house with an interesting history. As they drove away, Elara looked back one more time. She could have sworn she saw the raven standing in an upstairs window, waving goodbye.</p>
                
                <p>Back home, life returned to normal. Elara went to school, read her books, and listened to the whispers of old objects. But now she understood something important: being special wasn't about having power over others. It was about knowing yourself, making good choices, and loving the people who mattered.</p>
                
                <p>And whenever she felt scared or unsure, she remembered the Heart of Thornwood and the choice she'd made. She had turned down unlimited power because she knew that true strength came from within.</p>
